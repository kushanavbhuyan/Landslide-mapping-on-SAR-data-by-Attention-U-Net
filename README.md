# Landslide mapping on SAR data by Attention-U-Net

This repository contains codes and sample data from the journal paper "Rapid Mapping of landslide on SAR data by Attention U-net" by [Nava et al (2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/6/1449/htm).
With this repository files you can train the Attention U-Net segmentation model on Sentinel-1 SAR amplitude landslide data sampled for the Hokkaido multiple landslide event of September 2018.
